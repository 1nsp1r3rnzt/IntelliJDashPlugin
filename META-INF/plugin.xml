  <description><![CDATA[
A simple and intelligent plugin for the IntelliJ Platform (IntelliJ IDEA, RubyMine, WebStorm, PhpStorm, PyCharm, Android Studio) that provides keyboard shortcut access for Dash.

<br />
<h3>Usage</h3>
The default shortcut assigned in the plugin is <b>Mac-Shift-D</b>.
It either uses the caret position for the search, or the current selection. The plugin will identify the currently used programming language through context and request filtered search results accordingly.
<br />
<h3>Dash</h3>
Dash is a Mac application for rapid search of developer documentation. There is a free, fully functional version with nags. It can be downloaded <a href="http://kapeli.com/dash">here</a>.<br />
<br />
<h3>What's new</h3>
In the past months I have been adding and testing new features for the plugin. I am now happy to release a lot of these additions that will make your search results just better. <br />
<br />
From now on code in strings will be detected. This way it is no longer necessary to select a specific word, the plugin will automatically know what you want to look up by the caret position. A lot of strings contain SQL code and for these your results will only from a SQL docset. In Project Settings -> SQL Dialects you can set which SQL docset you want to search. There are docsets available for MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite.<br />
<br />
If you have the "Regular Expressions" cheatsheet installed in Dash you can lookup groups, quantifiers and special characters really quickly. Just try and check what /\v/ means.<br />
<br />
Android projects get results from the Android docs, not Java. Java results depend on the projects SDK setting, searching either Java 6, 7 or 8. The same goes for Python 2 or 3. Apart from that I added support for Bash, Go, Haskell, Lua, Markdown, Scala and TypoScript. Language support for JavaScript and others has been extended.<br />
<br />
Simplicity is really important to me, that's why I always try to keep the plugin smart and settings free. I hope this help you spend less time searching the reference. Make the best of it.<br />
