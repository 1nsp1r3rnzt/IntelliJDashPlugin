A simple plugin for AppCode (and other IntelliJ based IDEs) that provides keyboard shortcut access to Dash. This is necessary as the
'Services' menu is not populated in AppCode (apparently a Java limitation).

Install Dash.jar in this folder as a plugin.

Dash is a Mac application for rapid search of developer documentation. It is free with nags to persuade you to pay and lose the
nags. The free version is fully functional and super-useful. Get karma for buying and supporting the developer :) It can be downloaded here:

The default shortcut assigned in the plugin is Mac-Shift-D. It either uses the current selection for the search, or the caret
position.

Please feel free to request improvements, or fork-it and make them yourself!
